Hi there!

I’m glad you are visiting my blog. Here I share my experience on learning English on high levels.
In March, I passed IELTS with 7,5 points. Now I’ve been trying to boost it to C2 level.
I’ve enrolled on a CPE preparation course, and I’m planning to have a go in CPE next summer.
So, if you entertain the idea of going through these stages, you may find my blog useful.
Together we’ll venture in the unknown depths and understated elegance of English!
