On my way to the proficient English, there’s been a number of web sites and podcasts I’ve been reaching out to endless times. As I’ve found them invaluable, and I'm delighted to recommend them to you. I just want to say upfront that this is not an advertisement, so no string attached on my side. The reason I mention these particular resources is that they are free of charge and hence available for everyone.


# BBC learning English 

[BBC Learning English](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/ "Go to BBC Learning English")

The best free course of English on the Internet. It contains full-fledged courses for learners of different levels and separate exercises for pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar. The “News English” section with links to the YouTube channel comes as a valuable bonus.


# Youglish 

[Youglish](http://www.just-the-word.com/ "Go to Youglish")

Feel embarrassed by your accent? Native speakers sound alien to you? This resource sets out to help learners become more confident and avoid so unneeded cringeworthiness. You can put in here any word or phrase you are struggling to pronounce and check how natives say it. The website will play you a selection of videos from YouTube (news bulletins, films, podcasts, interviews etc.) with the word requested. What is more, it allows users to switch the accents – United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Scotland and New Zealand are available.


# Phonetic dictionary

Simple as it is, the habit of checking with a phonetic dictionary can work magic. As far as I am concerned, I seek it out not only to find tricky words, but also to gain the upper hand over fossil mistakes.


# Write and improve 

[Write and improve](https://writeandimprove.com/ "Go to Write and improve")

This tool is provided by the University of Cambridge as part of its methodical materials for CAE and CPE test takers. It helps learners boost their writing skills. Before starting, you should select your current level or choose writing just for fun. The site offers a variety of topics and, more important, feedback to your essays.  
 
# Deepl write 

[Deepl write](https://www.deepl.com/en/write "Go to Deeple write")

Deepl is a quality AI-translator. Unlike “Write and improve”, here you can check any random writing of yours and get advice regarding style and tone. It even accounts whether the user prefers British or American English and suggests remarks based on this premise. However, those with C1-C2 levels may find Deepl a bit too formulaic. Congratulations then – you are smarter than AI!

# Just the word 

[Just the word](https://www.just-the-word.com/ "Go to Just the word")

It comes as an indispensable resource when you are not sure about connotations and context in which the word in question can be used. Just enter any word there and see which combinations are common and sound authentic for natives. 

# Let them talk

Let’s switch to podcasts. One of my personal must-sees is “Let them talk” conducted by a funny and intelligent guy named Gideon. With his fine sense of humour, he exposes his audiences to the trickiest aspects of English and presents the material in a way that even sophisticated and commonly mistaken things become clear. Cherry on the top is cultural and historical journeys to the deep roots of the English language. 

# English with Lucy

What makes me inevitably return to the videos from this YouTube channel is Lucy’s exquisite accent – a fancy blend of Standard Southern British English (SSBE) and posh English. For me personally, Lucy is a perfect choice to emulate. Among the video stores, I would highlight the parts about commonly used idioms and British expressions, and a series about the differences in various English accents.

_Don’t forget that the key to mastering English is constant exposure!_
