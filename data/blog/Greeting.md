Hi there! 

I’m glad you are visiting my blog. Here I share my experience on learning English on high levels.  In March, I passed IELTS with 7,5 points. NowI’ve been trying to boost it to C2 level. I’ve enrolled on a CPE preparationcourse and I’m planning to have a go in CPE next summer. So, if you entertainthe idea of going through these stages, you may find my blog useful. Together we’ll venture in the unknown depths and understated elegance of English!
