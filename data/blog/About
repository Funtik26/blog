journalist, copywriter, technical writer

Welcome to my blog! 

I had worked as a journalist in an independent mass media entity for 15 years, but twelve mouths ago, I decided to have a go in technical writing, got a job in an information security company. Here I am going to share guides, tips, reviews, analytical notes, and my thoughts on cutting-edge trends in the world of technologies. Hope to convert sophisticated information into something readable.
